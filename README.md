### **Fix production issues faster by generating distributed traces, metrics and logs for any application in minutes, without code changes.**

- üßë‚Äçüíª **No code changes** - Odigos detects the programming language of your applications and apply automatic instrumentation accordingly.
- üìñ **Open technologies** - Applications are instrumented using well-known, battle-tested open source observability technologies such as [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and [eBPF](https://ebpf.io).
- üöÄ **Boost your existing monitoring tools** - No need for changing tools. Use your favourite tool, with much more data.
- ‚ú® **Works on any application** - Get automatic distributed traces and metrics even for applications written in Go. Odigos leverage eBPF in a unique way that removes the need to manually instrument even compiled languages.
- üî≠ **Observability by default** - Automatically get traces, metrics and logs for every new deployed application.
