The process odigos takes to instrument workloads is as follows:

## Instrumentation Label Added to Workload

When a user wants to instrument a workload, they add the following label to the workload or to the namespace:

```yaml
odigos-instrumentation: enabled
```

or use Odigos UI which will add the label to the workload.

If you expect to see data from a workload but don't, check that the label is present, for example:

```shell
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}'
```

## Language Detection

After an `odigos-instrumentation` label is added to a workload, odigos will attempt to detect the programming language
of the containers in the workload pods and write the detected language to an `instrumentedapplications.odigos.io` CRD in same namespace.

The resulting language is used to determine which instrumentation to apply.

If your workload is labeled, verify that the `instrumentedapplications.odigos.io` CRD exists:

```shell
kubectl get instrumentedapplications.odigos.io -n <namespace>
```

and that `languages` array contains the expected content.

## Instrumentation Device

Once a supported language is detected and the `instrumentedapplications.odigos.io` CRD is created,
odigos will wait until a destination is added, and OpenTelemetry Collectors are deployed to the cluster which can receive the telemetry.

To inject the instrumentation agent into pods, odigos will patch the workload template containers with a resource based on the detected language. It would look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    odigos-instrumentation: enabled
  name: my-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - resources:
          limits:
            instrumentation.odigos.io/go-ebpf-community: "1"
```

The `instrumentation.odigos.io/go-ebpf-community` resource limit instruct odigos on how to mount the relevant OpenTelemetry agent and environment variables into the container, 
and which processes should be instrumented with eBPF.
