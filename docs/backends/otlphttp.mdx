title: "OTLP http"
---

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines, Odigos support sending data to any OTLP http endpoint.

- Notice that if your backend expects [OTLP over gRPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/#configuration-options) you should use the [OTLP gRPC](/backends/otlp) destination instead.
- If your backend is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

  adding new integrations.

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the endpoint of the OTLP gRPC server.

The endpoint format is `http://host:port`.
- host is required
- port is optional and defaults to the port of the scheme (`80` / `443`). OTLP/HTTP sometimes uses port `4318`, in which case it should be specified.
- the signal path (e.g. `/v1/traces` / `/v1/metrics` / `/v1/logs`) is added automatically and should not be included in the endpoint.

### Using Basic Authentication

This section is relevant if your OTLP http endpoint requires [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) (username and password).

To configure basic authentication, use the optional config options `Basic Auth Username` and `Basic Auth Password`.
