## Configuring Jaeger Backend

Version v1.35 of Jaeger introduced the ability to receive OpenTelemetry trace data via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).
This allows to create a new Jaeger backend by simply specifying the Jaeger OTLP gRPC unencrypted URL.

The endpoint format is `host:port`. 
- host is required
- port is optional and defaults to the default OTLP gRPC port `4317`.
