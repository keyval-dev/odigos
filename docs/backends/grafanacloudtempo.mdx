To send traces to Grafana Cloud Tempo, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Endpoint** - This is the URL of the Tempo service, in the form of `host:port`. For example: `tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443`.
You can find the endpoint under the "Sending data to Tempo" section.
- **Username** - You can find the username in the "Sending data to Tempo" section under the "basic_auth" yaml field. 
The username is a number.
- **Password** - This field is refered to as "password" or "Grafana.com API Token" in the Grafana Cloud UI. 
You can manage tokens in your "Account Settings" page under the "SECURITY" section in the "Access Policies" page.
Make sure your token scope includes "traces:write" scope.
