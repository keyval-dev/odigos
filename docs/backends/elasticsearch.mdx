## Configuring Elasticsearch Backend

The only required field is the Elasticsearch endpoint. This endpoint must be a valid URL for your Elasticsearch cluster.

- Scheme can be `http` or `https`. If `https` is used
- If port is not specified, it defaults to 9200.

The following fields are optional:

- **Traces Index** - The name of the index where traces will be stored. Defaults to `trace_index`.
- **Logs Index** - The name of the index where logs will be stored. Defaults to `log_index`.

## https

If your Elasticsearch cluster uses `https`, you can provide the certificate authority (CA) to validate the server certificate.

The content should be the certificate in PEM format (starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and ends with `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`).

If empty, the system root CA will be used to validate the server certificate.

## Authentication

If your Elasticsearch cluster requires authentication, you can provide the username and password.
