This page describes how to configure Odigos to use Grafana Cloud Prometheus as a **metrics** backend.

Notice: these instructions are for the Grafan cloud **managed** Prometheus service. 
If you run a self hosted Prometheus instance, please follow the instructions in the [Prometheus](/backends/prometheus) page.

To send metrics to Grafana Cloud Prometheus, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Prometheus Remote Write Endpoint** - This is the URL of the Prometheus service. 
From the grafana cloud UI, Prometheus page, make sure you copy the URL from "Remote Write Endpoint" section,
and not the first Endpoint which is used for queries.
This url should look like: `https://{hostname}.grafana.net/api/prom/push` (path should be `/api/prom/push`)
- **Username / Instance ID** - You can find the prometheus page.
The username is a number.
- **Password** - This field is refered to as "password" or "Grafana.com API Token" in the Grafana Cloud UI. 
You can manage tokens in your "Account Settings" page under the "SECURITY" section in the "Access Policies" page.
Make sure your token scope includes "metrics:write" scope.
