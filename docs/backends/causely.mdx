## Configuring the Causely Backend

To complete adding a new Causely backend, input the following information into the Odigos UI

### Causely Destination Settings

To send Metrics/Traces to Causely, you need to configure the Causely URL in the Odigos UI.
This destination is for the Causely Mediator Service, so you will need to have a Causely instance running and accessible from the k8s cluster running odigos.

#### Endpoint

The endpoint URL is the combined `<protocol>://<hostname>:<port>` to access your Causely Mediator service.

- Protocol should be `http`; using `https` or omitting it will automatically be converted to `http`
- Hostname should typically follow the format: `mediator.<namespace>`
    - `namespace` is the k8s namespace where the Causely Mediator service is deployed
- Default port is `4317`; if no port is specified, it will be appended automatically

Example: `http://mediator.causely:4317`
