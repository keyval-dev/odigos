## Prerequisites

- Odigos Pro license key for VM Agent.
- Linux machine running services managed by systemd.
- Debian or RPM based Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, etc.).

## DEB Installation

For debian based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc), install odigos with APT:

1. Set up APT with Odigos deb repository and GPG key:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
wget -q -O - https://apt.fury.io/odigos/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/odigos.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/odigos.gpg] https://apt.fury.io/odigos/ * *" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odigos.list
```

2. Update APT package index after adding the odigos repository and install Odigos package:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install odigos
```

4. Add your Odigos Pro license key to the agent configuration file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/service.yaml`:

```shell
on_prem:
  token: "<your_license_key>"
```

5. Configure which systemd services to instrument and where to send telemetry data by editing the agent configuration file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml`. See the [Reference](/vmagent/configuration/reference) for more information.

6. Start the Odigos VM Agent systemd service:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable --now odigos-vmagent
```

Odigos VM Agent is now installed on your system and enabled as a systemd service.
