Trigger the demo application by sending a request to the service:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/isMember
```

This will generate a trace that will be sent to the Jaeger backend.

To see the traces open [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) in your browser and explore the traces. If Jaeger is running on a remote machine, replace `localhost` with the IP.

If you do not have HTTP access to the machine, the pipeline can still be checked through Jaeger metrics:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:14269/metrics | grep membership
```
