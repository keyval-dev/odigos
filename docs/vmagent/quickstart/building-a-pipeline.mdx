The default installation comes with only debug destination configured. That helps you to make sure that the Odigos is been able to instrument your applications, but will not too much more than that.
We will now set up odigos to auto-instrument our demo application and send the traces to Jaeger.

Save the following configuration to the file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml`:

```shell
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml <<EOF
sources:
  systemd:
    services:
    - service_name: membership
destinations:
- name: demo-jaeger
  type: jaeger
  config:
    JAEGER_URL: localhost:44317
  signals:
  - TRACES
EOF'
```

And reload the agent to apply the new configuration:

```shell
sudo systemctl reload odigos-vmagent
```
