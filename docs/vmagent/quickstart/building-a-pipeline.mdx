We will set up odigos to auto-instrument our demo application and send the traces to Jaeger.

Save the following configuration to the file `/etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml`:

```shell
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/odigos-vmagent/agent.yaml <<EOF
sources:
  systemd:
    services:
    - service_name: membership
destinations:
- name: demo-jaeger
  type: jaeger
  config:
    JAEGER_URL: localhost:44317
  signals:
  - TRACES
EOF'
```

And reload the agent to apply the new configuration:

```shell
sudo systemctl reload odigos-vmagent
```
